# AutoVidAI: The Automated Social Media Video Engine

AutoVidAI is a headless, API-first orchestration engine built in Python to fully automate the production of short-form social media videos. The goal is to create a fully autonomous, "set and forget" content pipeline by composing a series of micro-tasks powered by best-in-class APIs.

The engine currently operates as a 5-stage workflow, passing structured JSON payloads between each stage to maintain state.

🚀 How It Works
The system takes a single-word niche (e.g., "Stoicism") and executes the following automated pipeline:
 * Stage 1: Content Strategy (Idea Engine)
   * Uses Google's Gemini API to brainstorm a structured, potentially viral video concept based on the input niche.
 * Stage 2: Scripting (Scriptwriter)
   * Takes the concept from Stage 1 and uses further LLM processing to expand it into a detailed, scene-by-scene script optimized for short-form video.
 * Stage 3: Asset Generation (Media Engine)
   * Makes parallel API calls to source all necessary media. It fetches relevant stock video clips from the Pexels API and generates realistic TTS voiceovers for each scene's narration using the ElevenLabs API.
 * Stage 4: Rendering (Video Assembly)
   * Assembles the final edit by sending the script, video assets, and audio assets to the Shotstack Video API for programmatic, cloud-based rendering.
 * Stage 5: Distribution (In Development)
   * The final stage will be responsible for programmatically uploading the finished video to social media platforms.
🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
This project is a demonstration of API orchestration and building a resilient, multi-step automated workflow.
 * Orchestration & Logic: Python
 * Core Libraries: requests, python-dotenv, shotstack-sdk
 * AI & Content APIs:
   * Google Gemini API: For idea generation and scripting.
   * Pexels API: For high-quality stock video footage.
   * ElevenLabs API: For realistic text-to-speech voiceover synthesis.
 * Cloud Rendering:
   * Shotstack API: For programmatic video editing and rendering.
⚙️ Setup and Installation
To get this project running locally, follow these steps.
1. Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/mamun-apu/autovidai-engine.git
cd autovidai-engine

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:
This project requires a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it (on macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies:
Install all the required Python packages.
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

4. Set Up Environment Variables:
You will need API keys from all the services used in this project.
 * Create a .env file in the root of the project: touch .env
 * Add the following lines to your .env file, replacing the placeholders with your actual keys:
   GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_KEY_HERE"
PEXELS_API_KEY="YOUR_PEXELS_KEY_HERE"
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="YOUR_ELEVENLABS_KEY_HERE"
SHOTSTACK_API_KEY="YOUR_SHOTSTACK_KEY_HERE"

▶️ How to Run
Once the setup is complete, you can run the entire pipeline with a single command from the project's root directory:
python3 main.py

The script will print status updates for each stage to the console. The final rendered video URL will be displayed at the end of a successful run.
🗺️ Future Roadmap
This project is an ongoing proof-of-concept. The planned next steps include:
 * Stage 5 (Distributor): Implementing programmatic uploads using the YouTube Content API, handling OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
 * Scheduling & Job Queues: Integrating APScheduler for autonomous, scheduled runs and eventually moving to a more robust job queue system like Celery/Redis.
 * Front-End Control Panel: Building a React-based UI to manage niches, view render history, and provide a real-time logging dashboard (likely via WebSockets).
 * CI/CD: Setting up a simple CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
